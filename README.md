# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis | Cognifyz Internship

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my **Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**. It focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global restaurant dataset. 

The goal was to extract useful business insights using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, while dealing with messy real-world data and building visual storytelling around it.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset was provided as part of the internship. It includes:
- Restaurant names, cuisines, and locations
- Customer ratings and cost per meal
- Service types and delivery options

*Note: This is likely an international dataset and not restricted to Indian restaurants.*

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Top cuisines offered across restaurants
- Distribution of ratings vs. pricing
- City-wise restaurant availability
- Analysis of service types like delivery/dine-in
- Correlation between ratings and cost

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

This wasn’t just a plug-and-play project. I encountered and resolved:
- Missing data across multiple columns
- Unstructured and inconsistent string formats
- Ambiguities in column meanings (like rating scales, price ranges)
- Misleading outliers that skewed visual interpretations
- Dataset origin was unknown — required cautious assumptions
